### Minor Changes

- [#253](https://github.com/haverstack/core/pull/253) [`8a31b4e`](https://github.com/haverstack/core/commit/8a31b4ecb0117c86e1c5004c52f73fec9730f625) Thanks [@cuibonobo](https://github.com/cuibonobo)! - Sort by a top-level content field: `query({ sort: { contentField: 'publishedAt', direction: 'desc' } })`. A consumer wanting a bounded page in a meaningful order previously had to page the whole matched set and sort it in memory — a cost that grew with the stack while the page stayed the same size.

  `QuerySort` gains a `contentField` member beside `field` rather than widening `field` to a string: a content field may be named `version`, and a `'content.'` prefix collides with the filter path separator. Over the wire the two are `?sortContent=` and `?sort=`, and a request naming both is refused.

  The ordering is defined once in core so no two adapters answer one query differently. A field orders as the kind its schema declares — dates as instants, booleans as false-then-true — a record holding no value at the field sorts last in both directions, numbers precede text where types disagree about a field name, and text orders by a case- and accent-folded key (`apple`, `Émile`, `Zebra`) rather than by code point. What that fold does not promise — locale tailoring, script-aware or natural-number ordering — is stated in `docs/spec/data-model.md` § Text ordering.

  SQLite-backed adapters materialize a `content_sort` index, maintained on every write alongside `file_refs`, and only for top-level scalars — the same line `file-ref` indexing draws.

  `AdapterCapabilities` gains `contentFieldSort`, and `sortableFields` is now enforced rather than merely declared: a sort an adapter has not declared throws `StackQueryError` instead of being answered in some other order. `sortableFields` is typed `NativeSortField[]`, since content fields are unbounded and an adapter that indexes content for sorting indexes every top-level scalar.

  `MemoryAdapter` now honors `sort`, where it previously returned insertion order whatever the query asked for.

### Minor Changes

- [#250](https://github.com/haverstack/core/pull/250) [`0c76cb7`](https://github.com/haverstack/core/commit/0c76cb7b51f2ea407521ae1df1ff0c8e5852d53e) Thanks [@cuibonobo](https://github.com/cuibonobo)! - Add `Stack.getAttachmentRecords(fileId)`, the candidate set `firstRecordedAttachment()` orders: every `_attachment` record describing a file, family-wide by `baseId`, including soft-deleted and unlisted records, content-filtered only where the adapter declares `contentFieldQuery`, and cursor-walked to exhaustion. Sorted earliest-recorded first, so `records[0]` is the record that establishes the file's `mimeType` and the two helpers compose without the caller re-sorting. Core exported the tie-breaker but not the lookup that safely feeds it, leaving every server to re-derive a query with three ways to get it wrong.

  It lands on `Stack` and deliberately not on `StackClient`: the lookup answers a presentation question about an access decision already made, so a scoped version would impose a second, different permission check and silently drop metadata the requester is entitled to.

  `_attachment` lookups are now family-wide throughout, where they were pinned to `_attachment@1`. A record migrated to a later version of the family now establishes the file's `mimeType` (so a conflicting later upload is rejected, where it was previously accepted), is purged by `deleteAttachment()`, and is seen by `collectAttachmentGarbage()` — which previously could not discover a file whose only metadata record had been migrated.

  `StackRecordAdapter.deleteUnreferencedAttachmentRecords()` takes `metadataTypeIds: TypeId[]` in place of a single `metadataTypeId`. Core resolves the `_attachment` family to concrete typeIds before the call, so adapters still need no `baseId` concept of their own.

### Minor Changes

- [#227](https://github.com/haverstack/core/pull/227) [`59df7e6`](https://github.com/haverstack/core/commit/59df7e657a95cdc22a6f29c73c86e5d0e2d59b80) Thanks [@cuibonobo](https://github.com/cuibonobo)! - Repair search text FTS5 cannot parse instead of failing on it, so `5" nails`, `cats AND`, `-cats` and `cats-dogs` search for the terms they name. Everything outside a phrase is now reduced to an allow-list rather than a list of metacharacters to strip: FTS5's column-filter syntax is wider than `colname:term` — `-name` and `{a b}` filter columns with no colon — so a leading minus and an ordinary hyphenated word were reaching the engine as column names. Also closes an odd trailing quote, drops operators left without an operand, writes back the `AND` a group needs beside it, and removes control characters, which truncate SQLite's C string. Text inside a phrase is left alone. Behind that, any parse failure still reaching the engine surfaces as `StackQueryError` (`bad_request`/400) rather than a raw engine error a server has no code to map — scoped to `filter.search`, the one filter carrying a query language, so a failure in a parameter-built clause is still reported as the bug it is.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/haverstack/core/pull/225) [`46691c5`](https://github.com/haverstack/core/commit/46691c57f6b3b79f3d008fc29b2382c5eb3da006) Thanks [@cuibonobo](https://github.com/cuibonobo)! - Make nested content queryable: a `filter.content` key is now a dot-separated
  path, and an array anywhere along it is matched element-wise. `contact@1`
  stores `emails` as `[{ value, label }]`, so "which contact has this address"
  is `{ content: { 'emails.value': 'ada@example.com' } }` rather than a fetch
  and an in-memory scan. Containment falls out of the same rule, so
  `{ content: { tags: 'starred' } }` matches a record whose `tags` array
  contains it.

  This replaces the reading in which a filter key named one top-level field
  literally: `{ content: { 'a.b': 1 } }` now asks for `b` inside `a` on every
  adapter, and a field literally named `a.b` is no longer writable. Paths and
  field names are kept unambiguous from the write side rather than by an escape
  convention: a content field name may no longer contain `.`, `[`, `]`, `$`,
  `"`, `*`, or `#`, at every depth and in a declared schema alike, with
  `StackValidationError`. An escape convention fails silently when app code
  builds a key from a variable name; a write-time rule fails loudly while the
  caller can still pick another name. The guarantee that no key is reinterpreted
  as syntax is kept: a segment is carried as a bound parameter matched against a
  key, never assembled into a path expression, and a key that cannot be a path
  is `StackQueryError` (400) rather than an engine error.

  Multi-segment keys are gated on a new `nestedContentQuery` capability rather
  than on a widened `contentFieldQuery`: a foreign server declaring the latter
  matches whole field names, and reading that as a promise of traversal would
  hand a client an unfiltered superset presented as a filtered result. A
  discovery response omitting the flag means `false`.

  A `null` filter value now reads as "no value at the path, or a value that is
  null", so a missing intermediate matches. A path is capped at 32 segments,
  the longest both SQLite engines can execute. Nested fields stay unindexed, and
  depth multiplies cost: each segment fans out across every element of an array
  it meets, so a server owes the bound in wire-format's Bounding query cost.
  A `file-ref` nested in an array or object is now reachable by a filter but is
  still not indexed as a reference.

The key is quoted and escaped into the JSON path rather than interpolated, so `{ 'a.b': 1 }` now selects the field called `a.b` instead of `b` nested inside `a`, a key like `arr[0]` selects that field instead of an array element, and a key that is not path-shaped (`$.`, a stray bracket) is an ordinary zero-match filter instead of a raw SQLite "bad JSON path" error. Brings both SQLite adapters in line with the literal lookup every other adapter performs.

### Patch Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/haverstack/core/pull/215) [`c01f8de`](https://github.com/haverstack/core/commit/c01f8de8c3ddaa931e7de8b428d18fbe1eb4f38c) Thanks [@cuibonobo](https://github.com/cuibonobo)! - Add `@haverstack/record-adapter-do-sqlite` — a `StackRecordAdapter` over Cloudflare
  Durable Objects' SQLite storage, for Workers deployments with no Node runtime
  available. Reuses `SharedSqlRecordLogic`, the FTS5 schema and strategy, the query
  builder, cursor codec, and row mappers from `@haverstack/sqlite-shared` — the same
  shared layer `record-adapter-sqlite` is built on, now via its `./record` subpath
  (the token-store and file-lock pieces stay Node-only and unreachable from this
  adapter's bundle). No lock file: a Durable Object id maps to exactly one running
  instance, so the platform itself is the single-writer guarantee. No persist/flush
  step: every write through `ctx.storage.sql` is durable by the time the call returns.

  `@haverstack/sqlite-shared`'s `SqlExecutor` gained a `transaction<T>(fn: () => T): T`
  primitive, replacing the raw `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` statements `record-logic.ts`
  used to issue directly. Durable Object SQLite storage rejects those statements
  outright and does not roll back a write on a later exception the way an open SQL
  transaction would (verified against the real Workers runtime) — its real primitive
  is `ctx.storage.transactionSync(fn)`, a callback boundary that three independent
  string-based `exec()` calls can't reach. `record-adapter-sqlite`'s executor
  implements `transaction()` as literal `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` around `fn()`,
  behavior-identical to what the inline code did before — its full test suite passes
  unchanged.
