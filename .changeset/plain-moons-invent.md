Add `Stack.getAttachmentRecords(fileId)`, the candidate set `firstRecordedAttachment()` orders: every `_attachment` record describing a file, family-wide by `baseId`, including soft-deleted and unlisted records, content-filtered only where the adapter declares `contentFieldQuery`, and cursor-walked to exhaustion. Sorted earliest-recorded first, so `records[0]` is the record that establishes the file's `mimeType` and the two helpers compose without the caller re-sorting. Core exported the tie-breaker but not the lookup that safely feeds it, leaving every server to re-derive a query with three ways to get it wrong.

It lands on `Stack` and deliberately not on `StackClient`: the lookup answers a presentation question about an access decision already made, so a scoped version would impose a second, different permission check and silently drop metadata the requester is entitled to.

`_attachment` lookups are now family-wide throughout, where they were pinned to `_attachment@1`. A record migrated to a later version of the family now establishes the file's `mimeType` (so a conflicting later upload is rejected, where it was previously accepted), is purged by `deleteAttachment()`, and is seen by `collectAttachmentGarbage()` — which previously could not discover a file whose only metadata record had been migrated.

`StackRecordAdapter.deleteUnreferencedAttachmentRecords()` takes `metadataTypeIds: TypeId[]` in place of a single `metadataTypeId`. Core resolves the `_attachment` family to concrete typeIds before the call, so adapters still need no `baseId` concept of their own.
